/// Used to obtain files, that are primarily boot options, from arbitrary

/// # UEFI Spec Description
/// The EFI_LOAD_FILE_PROTOCOL is a simple protocol used to obtain files from
/// arbitrary devices.
///
/// When the firmware is attempting to load a file, it first attempts to use the
/// deviceâ€™s Simple File System protocol to read the file. If the file system
/// protocol is found, the firmware implements the policy of interpreting the
/// File Path value of the file being loaded. If the device does not support the
/// file system protocol, the firmware then attempts to read the file via the
/// EFI_LOAD_FILE_PROTOCOL and the LoadFile() function. In this case the
/// LoadFile() function implements the policy of interpreting the File Path
/// value.
